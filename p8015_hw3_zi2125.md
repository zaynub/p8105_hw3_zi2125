``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are user /
order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There
are also item variables – name, aisle, department, and some numeric
code. The data set shows an order number, and how long it has been since
the order was placed and also shows the item that is ordered and which
aisle and department it is located in.

How many aisles, and which are most items from?

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle:

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Make a table that shows most popular items in “baking ingredients”, “dog
food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits” aisles.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>%
  count(product_name) %>%
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>%
  filter(rank < 4) %>%
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |

| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

### Problem 2

``` r
accel_df = read_csv(file = "./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity.1:activity.1440,
    names_to = "minute",
    names_prefix = "activity.",
    values_to = "activity"
  ) %>% 
  group_by(day) %>% 
  mutate(
    minute = as.numeric(minute),
    day = as.factor(day),
    activity = as.numeric(activity),
    day = forcats::fct_relevel(day, c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")),
    weekday_or_weekend =  if_else(day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "Weekend", "Weekday")
  )

This tidy accel\_df dataset contains five weeks of accelerometer data
collected on a 63 year-old male with BMI 25, who was admitted to the
Advanced Cardiac Care Center of Columbia University Medical Center and
diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF). It has 50400 rows and 6
and contains variables week, day\_id, day, minute, activity,
weekday\_or\_weekend.

Now I am creating a table to show total activity variable for each day.

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarize(aggregate_activity = sum(activity)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

| week | day       | aggregate\_activity |
| ---: | :-------- | ------------------: |
|    1 | Friday    |           480542.62 |
|    1 | Monday    |            78828.07 |
|    1 | Saturday  |           376254.00 |
|    1 | Sunday    |           631105.00 |
|    1 | Thursday  |           355923.64 |
|    1 | Tuesday   |           307094.24 |
|    1 | Wednesday |           340115.01 |
|    2 | Friday    |           568839.00 |
|    2 | Monday    |           295431.00 |
|    2 | Saturday  |           607175.00 |
|    2 | Sunday    |           422018.00 |
|    2 | Thursday  |           474048.00 |

|    2 | Wednesday |           440962.00 |
|    3 | Friday    |           467420.00 |
|    3 | Monday    |           685910.00 |
|    3 | Saturday  |           382928.00 |
|    3 | Sunday    |           467052.00 |
|    3 | Thursday  |           371230.00 |
|    3 | Tuesday   |           381507.00 |
|    3 | Wednesday |           468869.00 |
|    4 | Friday    |           154049.00 |
|    4 | Monday    |           409450.00 |
|    4 | Saturday  |             1440.00 |
|    4 | Sunday    |           260617.00 |
|    4 | Thursday  |           340291.00 |
|    4 | Tuesday   |           319568.00 |
|    4 | Wednesday |           434460.00 |
|    5 | Friday    |           620860.00 |
|    5 | Monday    |           389080.00 |
|    5 | Saturday  |             1440.00 |
|    5 | Sunday    |           138421.00 |
|    5 | Thursday  |           549658.00 |
|    5 | Tuesday   |           367824.00 |
|    5 | Wednesday |           445366.00 |

No apparent trends stand out just from looking at this aggregate table.
However, it is interesting to note that the level of activity on the
last two Saturdays was significantly lower than any of the other days.

Next, I am creating a plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses
for each day.

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = activity)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = day)) +
  stat_smooth(method = "loess", formula = y ~ x, size = 1, se = FALSE)
```

### Problem 3

Load the dataset:

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
```

This dataset contains 2595176 rows and 7 columns.
