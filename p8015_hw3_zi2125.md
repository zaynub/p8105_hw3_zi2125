### Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are user /
order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There
are also item variables – name, aisle, department, and some numeric
code. The data set shows an order number, and how long it has been since
the order was placed and also shows the item that is ordered and which
aisle and department it is located in.

How many aisles, and which are most items from?
